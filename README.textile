"Where's the MBTA?" makes use of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Open Data to predict arrival times to MBTA* transit stations. It is by no means feature complete. More transit types and systems will be added later on.

This project was born out of a proof of concept for writing a namespaced ClojureScript web application that not only used ClojureScript for server side and client side programming, but was able to share specific parts of code between both environments.

The web application is located at http://wheresthembta.com.
